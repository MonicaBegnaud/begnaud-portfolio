            <h2>Mashed Potatoes</h2> 
            <p>Mashed potatoes are my personal favorite. I prefer them with garlic and too much butter. My dad makes them with little pieces of green apple and onion mixed in.</p>

            <h2>Green Bean Casserole</h2>
            <p>The green bean casserole has somehow become my assigned task. My family swears I make it better even though I just follow the recipe on the back of the crispy onions.</p>

            <h2>Bread/Rolls</h2>
            <p>My children will be very upset that bread is not the first item on the list. Every year it is a competition to see who can eat the most rolls.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Sweet Potato Casserole</h2>
            <p>It is an ongoing debate on whether or not you put marshmallows or crushed nuts on top of the casserole. My vote is for marshmallows every time.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Stuffing</h2>
            <p>My husband just considers stuffing wet bread and is not a fan, but I think it is an important staple to the overall meal.</p>
