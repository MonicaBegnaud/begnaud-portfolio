            This is a collection of some of my favorite book series. I specifically choose series instead of individual books because
            each individual book in the series is good on it's own but the collection as a whole is just so much better. The more books in a series 
            the more world building the author can do and it just sucks you into the story.

                    I really enjoyed the setting of these books as it was unlike anything I had read before.
                    The world combines technology with magic, but plays on how the two don't interact well
                    with each other and how Kate has to sort of balance between the two. There is a romantic 
                    element but it doesn't become the main focus.

                    This series had my attention from the very first book. It focuses on the classic themes
                    of sibling rivalry and deep ingrained traditions, but with a darker twist. Each sister 
                    is born with a magical gift, but are they really gifts?

                <p class="description">
                    Mercy is a VW mechanic who can also shapeshift into a coyote, and that works out in every 
                    day life about as well as you would expect. She is a loner that gets caught between all 
                    of the other major magical creatures; vampires, werewolves, the Fae. I not only really enjoyed
                    this series, but it's special to me because it is one my sister introduced me to.

                    Cassie is just trying to survive the death of her parents and being raised by vampires. 
                    She is a clairvoyant who, as most main characters are, turns out to be a lot more 
                    powerful than she or anyone else gave her credit for, despite her original main source of 
                    employment being reading people's fortunes in a Las Vegas casino.

                    I will admit I watched the show before reading the books, but the books stand alone in 
                    their own right even without the franchise it has become. You have your classic warring 
                    families who all think they should be in charge of everyone else, along with your 
                    dragons (always a positive) and the unexpected big bad. The characters are written to 
                    the point that you actually love or hate them as people. Plus the leather box set is 
                    really pretty with my funko pops.

                   These books have developed a kind of cult following, even if you don't agree with
                   the political air surrounding the author currently. But they will always remind me 
                   of my childhood, reading them in elementary school as they were still coming out. 
                   Rushing to the store for the new one and then staying up all night to read it in 
                   one sitting.
