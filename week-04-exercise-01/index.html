        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I modified the html and css code for cheese.com
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./neon-green-cheese.JPG" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />

        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>I changed one of the heading to display my love of cheese</li>
            <li>I changed the font of the heading I modified. As well as the text box background color and main site color.</li>
            <li>It is already a silly website. Now the background color is painful to look at.</li>
            <li>I was originally having trouble drilling down to the exact line of code I needed to edit. The elements panel also did not behave quite the same as VSC</li>
            <li>Bright dramatic change that would be obvious since the webpage did not have many large titles.</li>
        </ul>
